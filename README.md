# sub_worth
Analyse the use of subscription services

Goal of the project is to create an application that allows you to calculate the worth of any app subscriptions you have depending on how much time you spend on the given subscription. The user would enter how much time they want to spend on a given app subscription for the month to make it worthwhile. 
The kind of app subscriptions would be like Youtube Premium, Audible, Spotify etc. 


## Future work 

Allow you to input how much time you wish to spend on an app you are subscribed to
Get time spent on the app subscription at the end of the month
Allow you to stop subscription 
Stop multiple app subscriptions to meet a savings goal
